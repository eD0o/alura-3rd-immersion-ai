## **Lesson 2 - How to Talk to AI and Make It Work for You**

**Zero-shot and Few-shot (Explanation):**

- **Zero-shot**: This is when you ask the AI to perform a task without giving it any examples beforehand. It relies entirely on what it has already learned during training.

  - üß† _Example_: "Summarize this text." ‚Äî even if you don‚Äôt show it how to summarize, the AI tries to do it based on its prior knowledge.

- **Few-shot**: This is when you provide a few examples to guide the AI on how to complete the task. These examples help the AI understand the format, tone, or logic you expect.

  - üß† _Example_:

    - Input:

      - "Translate: 'Hola' ‚Üí 'Hello'"
      - "Translate: 'Gracias' ‚Üí 'Thank you'"
      - "Translate: 'Adi√≥s' ‚Üí ?"

    - Output:

      - "Goodbye"

You‚Äôre essentially ‚Äútraining‚Äù the AI with a small number of examples during the prompt itself.
